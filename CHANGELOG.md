## [Unreleased]

_Next: 1.2 — closed-loop validation moat (scalar drawing-score, pre-plan clarification, iterative refiner + transaction-stack isolation)._

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- **`selection_get`** (Entity Query, COM backend): reads AutoCAD's implied
  ("pickfirst") viewport selection — the entities the user highlighted with
  grips before invoking the AI — and returns their handles + `EntityInfo`.
  This lets the AI scope work to exactly what the user picked
  (`dimension_auto(selection_get()["handles"])`) instead of acting on the whole
  drawing. Resolves [#1](https://github.com/U-C4N/Autocad-MCP/issues/1) — the
  layer-juggling workaround is no longer needed. Surfaces the `PICKFIRST` sysvar
  state so an empty selection is self-explanatory. The ezdxf headless backend
  has no viewport, so it returns `ok=False` with an empty handle list (same
  shape, never raises). Tool count: 110 → 111.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-19

Correctness, cross-backend parity, and an **enforced** quality gate, landed across four audited
sprints (see `docs/analysis/`). 318 tests, ruff-clean.

### Added
- **Premium drafting workflow** (shared across both backends): `drawing_plan`, `drawing_critique`
  (ISO-128 focuses), `point_from_snap`, `drawing_apply_iso_layers`, `dimension_auto`,
  `entity_select_smart`, `construction_xline` / `construction_clear`.
- **Deterministic geometry** for exact OSNAP coordinates: `point_intersection`
  (line/line, line/circle, circle/circle) and `point_tangent` (external point → circle).
- **Engineering / deterministic CAD layer**: involute gear front view + section A-A,
  DIN 6885 keyed bore, ISO A3 title block, and the 8-step `drawing_finalize` validator.
- **HTTP bearer-token auth**: `StaticTokenVerifier` wired into FastMCP when `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is set.
- Mocked-COM test harness (`tests/test_com_backend.py` + Sprint-3/4 suites) — COM logic is now
  regression-tested on Linux CI without a live AutoCAD.
- `entity_create_mtext` rotation parameter; `dimension_auto` layer override; `bounding_box` /
  ARC `length` / TEXT-MTEXT `rotation`+`char_height` on both backends; `BlockInfo.description`.
- Security module (`security.py`), centralized config (`config.py`), `.env.example`, path
  validation, command/LISP sanitization, ruff config, pre-commit hooks, pytest-cov.

### Changed
- **`drawing_finalize` now enforces the premium critique** in addition to the structural validator:
  leftover construction geometry, non-ISO-128 lineweights, untrimmed corners, duplicate entities,
  and dimension overlap block the gate (was advisory-only). `strict_critique=True` fails on warnings too.
- **`drawing_save_as` derives the on-disk format from the file extension** — `part.dxf` writes DXF,
  not DWG. ezdxf refuses to mislabel a `.dwg` file.
- Dimension and construction layers resolve from the active layer set (iso13567 → `M-DIMEN-T-N` /
  `M-CONST-E-N`, not the hardcoded `DIM` / `CONSTRUCTION`).
- Premium meta-tools lifted into the shared `AutoCADBackend` base class (single source of truth).
- Dead code removed (`section.py`, `generate_tooth_profile`, `CommandResult`, `set_layer_active`, …).

### Fixed
- ezdxf `dimension_aligned` / `dimension_angular` raised `TypeError` (wrong ezdxf 1.4 args) — fixed.
- Full-circle polar array placed a duplicate copy over the original — fixed (divisor = count).
- `entity_offset` ignored `side_x`/`side_y` on both backends — now honored (and COM no longer leaks extras).
- COM `entity_create_hatch` built an associative hatch then deleted its boundary — now non-associative.
- Lineweight mm-vs-hundredths truncation wiped ISO-128 weights — fixed via `normalize_lineweight`.
- **`view_screenshot` / `drawing_export_pdf` could SIGSEGV** (matplotlib GUI backend in a worker thread)
  — now render headless via `Agg` (`Figure` + `FigureCanvasAgg`).
- `entity_select_smart` `length_range` silently rejected all ARCs (no `length`) — fixed.
- Gear tooth profile self-overlapped for high tooth counts (z ≥ ~42); section view drew duplicate
  bore lines; validator keyway heuristic was a permanent false-negative — all fixed.
- COM `system_run_lisp` always reported `"nil"`; `system_set_variable` didn't coerce numeric sysvars
  — fixed. `system_about` tool groups / `_registered_tool_count` no longer drift or surface `-1`.
- `drawing_new` bootstrap failures now surface as `degraded` instead of reporting success.

### Security
- HTTP remote-bind guard now fires on **every** launch path (including `fastmcp run server.py:mcp`),
  not only the `__main__` block — closing an anonymous-remote-bind gap.
- AutoLISP allowlist bypass-vector regression tests (newline injection, symbol aliasing, `vla*`/`acet-*`,
  `c:` custom commands).
- COM apartment leak bounded (`CoUninitialize` on teardown); transaction commit/rollback and
  `system_run_lisp` now respect the CMDACTIVE guard.
